ERROR 2019-11-04 12:44:35 run_playbook 执行/home/aron/Ops/media/playbook/2019/11/1/ping.yml失败，原因: The field 'hosts' has an invalid value, which includes an undefined variable. The error was: 'test' is undefined

The error appears to have been in '/home/aron/Ops/media/playbook/2019/11/1/ping.yml': line 1, column 3, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


- hosts: "{{ test }}"
  ^ here
We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
missing quotes.  Always quote template expression brackets when they
start a value. For instance:

    with_items:
      - {{ foo }}

Should be written as:

    with_items:
      - "{{ foo }}"

exception type: <class 'ansible.errors.AnsibleUndefinedVariable'>
exception: 'test' is undefined
